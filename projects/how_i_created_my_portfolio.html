                <h2>A Guide to Building a Remote Sensing & GIS Portfolio on GitHub Pages</h2>
                <p>Showcasing your work is one of the most effective ways to demonstrate your skills, especially in a specialized field like Remote Sensing and GIS. Instead of relying solely on a resume, I decided to build a dedicated online portfolio. This blog post outlines my journey, from choosing the right tools to deploying the final website, all for free using GitHub Pages.</p>
                <p>My goal was simple: create a clean, professional, and easily accessible portfolio to highlight my projects. I wanted something that was fully under my control, didn't require complex backend servers, and could be version-controlled. Using a combination of plain HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages was the perfect fit.</p>

                <h2>The Planning & Design Phase</h2>
                <p>Before I wrote a single line of code, I spent a lot of time on research and planning. The first step in my journey was to create a PDF portfolio to compile all my projects and content in a single place. With the content organized, I was ready to think about how to present it online.</p>
                <p>I started by exploring different options for hosting a portfolio, including platforms like Wix and WordPress, setting up a personal website, and using static site hosting services. I ultimately chose GitHub Pages for its flexibility and cost-effectiveness.</p>
                <p>To get a sense of what a great GIS portfolio looks like, I studied several examples. I found inspiration in portfolios shared by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spatialthoughts/" target="_blank">Ujaval Gandhi</a>, which helped me understand different layouts and content strategies.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.pokateomaps.com/portfolio" target="_blank">https://www.pokateomaps.com/portfolio</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://www.alicias.io/" target="_blank">https://www.alicias.io/</a></li>

                </ul>
                <p>With these examples in mind, I outlined the core sections I needed for a comprehensive portfolio:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <b>prominent header </b>with my name, title, and a clear navigation menu.</li>
                    <li>An<b> "About Me" </b>section with a professional photo and a brief summary of my experience.</li>
                    <li>A <b>"Projects" </b>section to showcase my work with a grid of cards, each linking to a more detailed case study.</li>
                    <li>A <b>"Skills" </b>section to list my proficiency in software, programming languages, and geospatial concepts.</li>
                    <li>A <b>"Contact" </b>section with links to my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>The Technical Implementation</h2>
                <h3>Step 1: Structuring the Pages with HTML</h3>
                <p>I started by creating the main page, <code>index.html</code>. I focused on using semantic HTML5 tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to create a logical and accessible structure.</p>
                <p>For the project showcase, I used a grid of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements, each with a class of <code>project-card</code>. This made it easy to apply consistent styling. The "View more details" link on each card pointed to a separate HTML file in a <code>projects/</code> subfolder (e.g., <code>projects/tnhms.html</code>). This modular approach kept my main page clean and allowed for in-depth project descriptions.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Styling with CSS</h3>
                <p>The look and feel of the portfolio were crucial. In my <code>style.css</code> file, I used a few key techniques to keep the design clean and responsive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>**CSS Variables:**</code> I defined colors, border-radius, and box shadows in a <code>:root</code> block. This made it incredibly simple to maintain a consistent theme and make global changes quickly.</li>
                    <li><code>**Flexbox and CSS Grid:**</code> For the navigation bar and the projects/skills sections, I used Flexbox and CSS Grid to create dynamic, responsive layouts. A single line of code like <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code> made my life much easier than using floats or other older methods.</li>
                    <li><code>**Media Queries:**</code> To ensure the site looked great on a mobile phone, I used <code>@media</code> queries to adjust font sizes and change the layout to a single column on smaller screens.</li>
                    <li><code>**Font Awesome:**</code> For professional icons next to skills and contact links, I linked to Font Awesome. It's a quick and easy way to add visual flair.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Step 3: Creating Detailed Project Pages</h3>
                <p>Each project deserved its own space to shine. I created individual HTML files like <code>sm.html</code> and <code>tnhms.html</code> in a <code>projects</code> folder. These pages followed a similar template, with sections for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Project Overview:</b> A brief summary and a key image.</li>
                    <li><b>Project Details:</b> Lists of my role, the tools used, and my specific contributions.</li>
                    <li><b>Selected Visuals:</b> A gallery of high-quality maps, charts, and GIFs from the project.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- <p>A key detail here was the CSS link in the header: <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css"&gt;</code>. The <code>../</code> was essential to tell the browser to go up one level from the <code>projects</code> folder to find the <code>style.css</code> file.</p> -->
                <!-- <h3>Step 4: Resizing Images for Specific Pages</h3>
                <p>During this process, I realized the images on my main <code>index.html</code> page had a fixed height for a uniform look. However, the images on my project detail pages like <code>sm.html</code> were more varied and needed to be bigger.</p>
                <p>To solve this without affecting the main page, I added a specific <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block directly to <code>sm.html</code>'s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. This inline style block contained a new rule for <code>.projects-grid .project-card img</code> that overrode the height and width values from the main stylesheet. This way, the change only applied to that single page, keeping the main page's aesthetic intact.</p> -->

                <h2>How Gemini Helped Me Build This</h2>
                <p>I didn't build this portfolio alone. A key partner in my development process was Gemini. From initial brainstorming to solving specific coding challenges, Gemini provided invaluable assistance.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Initial Structure and Scaffolding:</b> I used Gemini to help me with the initial HTML structure for <code>index.html</code>. By providing the content I wanted to include, it helped me organize the page into logical sections like "About," "Projects," and "Skills."</li>
                    <li><b>CSS and Responsive Design:</b> Gemini helped me create the foundational CSS (<code>style.css</code>), providing the clean, professional look I wanted. It also guided me on how to use modern CSS features like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries to ensure my portfolio looked great on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
                    <li><b>Iterative Problem-Solving:</b> A perfect example of this was when I needed to resize images for my detailed project pages. I wanted the images on a page like <code>sm.html</code> to be larger and more prominent, but without changing the fixed-height style of the images on my main <code>index.html</code> page. Gemini outlined the exact steps to add a page-specific CSS rule, explaining the concept of CSS specificity to make sure my changes only applied where I wanted them.</li>
                    <!-- <li><b>Drafting Content:</b> The blog post you are reading right now was also drafted with Gemini's help. It provided a clear, well-structured narrative based on the technical steps I took, helping me articulate my process and share my experience with others.</li> -->
                </ul>
                <p>Working with an AI assistant like Gemini streamlined my workflow, acted as a coding consultant, and ultimately helped me create a better final product.</p>
